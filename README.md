# portfolio-optimizer

A template repository for a JSON-driven, auditable portfolio-optimization engine built on pandas and cvxpy.
Clone it (or click **Use this template**), keep the engine, and write your own loaders, rules, objective
terms, constraints, and sinks as ordinary Python functions.

A run loads a list of portfolios, then holdings, the universe, portfolio details, style constraints, and
any extra datasets; assembles them — attaching security analytics to holdings and the universe — through
named steps; applies business-logic rules; builds one pure-numpy problem per portfolio; hands it to a
configured solve step (a cvxpy problem built from the configured terms and constraints by default, or a
function of your own); independently re-verifies the answer without cvxpy; rounds it to whole-share
orders; publishes the orders; and writes a manifest that lets anyone reproduce and audit the run. A run
trades one side or both, and portfolios in a run couple through the side it trades on.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync --locked
cp .env.example .env
uv run --env-file .env portfolio-optimizer validate-config configs/example_run.json
uv run --env-file .env portfolio-optimizer run configs/example_run.json
```

The example runs two portfolios over three securities with a hand-checkable optimum; see
[the tutorial](docs/tutorial-first-run.md) for what to expect at each step.

## The one convention

A step is an ordinary function in a designated module; the JSON run config names it.

```python
# src/portfolio_optimizer/rules.py
class CapSingleNameParams(Params):
    max_weight: Decimal = Field(gt=0, le=1)


def cap_single_name(data: PortfolioData, params: CapSingleNameParams) -> PortfolioData: ...
```

```json
"rules": [{"name": "cap_single_name", "params": {"max_weight": "0.05"}}]
```

No decorators, no registries. The function may live in the template modules or in any package installed
in the environment: name it `my_firm.rules:cap_single_name` and the engine imports it from there — which
is how a firm shares loaders, rules, and sinks across desks, with the package's version recorded in every
manifest. Before any data loads, the engine imports every named function, checks its
signature, validates its `params` against the function's own model, and records its source hash in the
run manifest. Loaders, assembly steps, solve-order steps, objective terms, constraints, solve steps, and
sinks follow the same rule.

Run configs are validated three ways: live in your editor through `"$schema": "./run-config.schema.json"`,
by `portfolio-optimizer validate-config` (which also imports and checks every step), and by any JSON Schema
validator against [`configs/run-config.schema.json`](configs/run-config.schema.json).

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/{loaders,assembly,rules,solve_order,terms,solvers,sinks}.py` | **Yours to edit.** Each ships worked, tested examples. Shared steps live in your own installed package instead and are named `package.module:function`. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/engine/` | Loading and assembly, the rule pipeline, build, the solve stage, cvxpy-free verification, orders, the per-portfolio tasks, the derived dependency graph, the Dask cluster each run provisions for itself, manifest. Rarely edited. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/domain/` | Frame schemas, the per-portfolio data bundle and its optimizer frame, the pure-data problem spec and results, and `sides.py`: the side profiles — what a buy-only, sell-only, or two-sided run means, in numpy. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/config/` | The run-config models and the step resolver. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/cvx/` | `adapter.py`, the only module that imports cvxpy, and `sides.py`, the side profiles' cvxpy half: each side's decision variables and trade identity. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/solving.py` | The solve step's contract: `SolveRequest` in, `SolveResult` out. |
| `src/portfolio_optimizer/ratelimit.py` | Rate-limit pools loaders draw from, and `fan_out` for sources that answer one portfolio per call. |
| `configs/example_run.json`, `configs/run-config.schema.json`, `examples/data/` | The shipped example and the generated JSON Schema. |
| `benchmarks/profile_portfolio.py` | Times one portfolio through the pipeline stage by stage at a chosen book size and side; the numbers in `IDEAS.md` come from it. |
| `docs/` | Tutorial, how-to guides, reference, and explanation. |
| `IDEAS.md` | Threads that are not yet decisions, and known defects waiting to be fixed. |

## Development

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run pre-commit run --all-files   # ruff format, ruff check --fix, ty, uv lock, prettier for JSON
uv run pytest                       # unit, property, and smoke tests; warnings are errors
```

Every run provisions its own Dask cluster and tears it down when it ends: `PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZER_CLUSTER=local`
on a laptop needs nothing beyond the locked environment; on Kubernetes the `kubernetes` extra
(`uv sync --locked --extra kubernetes`) and the Dask operator. See [how to run on a cluster](docs/how-to-run-on-a-cluster.md).

Python 3.12 or newer. Dependencies are locked in `uv.lock`; solver versions are recorded in every manifest.
